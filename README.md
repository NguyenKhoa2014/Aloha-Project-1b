# Aloha Project part2
Programs and tools used:
    Visual Studio Code
    Google Chrome
    Dev tools

**Personal Learnings:**
    Building upon part 1 of the Aloha Project, I have added all the stretch goals and incorporated the javascript/jquery elements taught. Although wrapping my head around the how javascript/jquery works, the more I used it the easier it became to understand.

**HTML requirements:**
    - Incorporate a list-based navigation menu.

**CSS requirements:**
    - Be refactored to use a mobile-first responsive layout using flexbox (no floats!)

**RWD requirements:**
    - Be responsively designed using a mobile-first approach
    - Be optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, min-width: 600px and min-width: 1240px

**JS requirements:**
    - Incorporate “smooth scrolling” into the menu that navigates to specific headings in the page
    - Incorporate an image slider using a jQuery plugin for the featured product area (Flickity is a good choice)
    - Display an alert box that says “Thanks for subscribing!” whenever a user successfully submits the newsletter form with valid email address, otherwise they should see a message in the alert box that asks them to enter a valid email address

**Additional requirements:**
    - Take into account all feedback you received in the evaluation form for the first part of this project
    - Include the four additional products to be added to the featured product slider
    - Include the new product categories grid
    - Be sure to test your project completely in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE11) when you think you’re finished

**Stretch goals:**
    - Update the the cart icon in the top-right corner of the header every time the user clicks the “Add to Cart” button for a product (see the additional stretch goal design comp in the project assets folder)
    - Incorporate a fixed header at the top of the page (so that the navigation menu is always visible when the user scrolls down)
